This is a minimal test implementation of a tracking pan-tilt-zoom system based on:
 - Lumix DC-FZ80 camera
 - Unihertz Atom tiny android phone for the tag
 - Bescor pan tilt head
 - WitMotion BWT901CL IMU

Where possible I've tried to keep interfaces compatible with https://github.com/maiermic/robot-cameraman (a much more advanced project with a focus on image streaming and image-based tracking) to support a future merge.
